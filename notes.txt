# design elements

- `array.strides[]`
  - allows arrays to be used as queues
  - allows lightweight slices
  - should be in cumulative bytes, for fastest
- `array.dims[]`
- max rank of [3]
  - simplifies loop-over-all-elements

- common function structure
  - unless special case, always return int
    if not 0 (success/continue), the return code should either be processed or returned itself.
        use RETIF return any non-zero return code.

- SECTION for werbs
  - allows modularity/extensibility (just compile in another file)
     - without needing to modify the core
  - downside: werb struct size must be power of 2
